           <p>A little About me. Born in Edmonton Alberta. I am Currently in school rate now enrolled at Nait in the CNT program.
            I am a big fan of the Fantasy Genre in terms of reading.My first read was harry potter when I was grown up and I have sinced jumped
            from book to book. One of my favourite series is Brandon Sandersos's Stormlight Archive Series the books Span over 10
            novels long and are very In depth and intricate. I also enjoy watching many tv Series such as Game of thrones.
